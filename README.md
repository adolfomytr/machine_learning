# machine_learning
This repository contains different practical exercises for a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms.

We follow the structure of a machine learning pipeline, and we include techniques such as data preprocessing and feauture engineering, dimensionality reduction, balancing (imbalanced) data, and more. 

We also find the most suitable model (for some excercises) using the grid search method to try simultaneously different models with different parameters.
